Text Surgeon


This code is designed for a user to be able to alter text in order to provide different desired results. In the program the user is given a menu where they can select from a main menu different alterations they can make to a desired text string. Here are the options listed in the main menu: Option 1: Count Vowels and Consonants. Option 2: Swap two letters of choice Option 3: Flip order of the string. Option 4: Palindrome detector Option 5: Count word frequency. After the selected option is typed in the program will print out the desired string or count. 


How to run the program{

2. Compile the program using g++ assignment5.cpp -std=c++11

Limitations of the program
1. This program is designed to take in a string for the user each play, you cannot select an option to repeat the same string from the last calculation. 
2. You need to enter your menu input twice, it uses the first iteration to check for errors and I couldn't figure out how to stop that from happening.
